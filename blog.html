        <h2>CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on December 29, 2024</em></p>
        <p align="justify">The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a modern gene editing technique for cutting DNA at a targeted location. This approach helps us in targeted knockout or knockdown of any gene. CRISPR/Cas9 was identified in bacterial immune system and currently being used as a powerful tool in genomic research. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has two main components: a DNA-cutting protein Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) and an RNA molecule called guide RNA. The Cas9 and guide RNA bind together to form a complex which can bind and cut a specific DNA sequence. First the Cas9 binds with the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) sequence and then the guide RNA unwinds the double helix of the target DNA. The guide RNA is designed such a way that it can binds with the target position of the gene that need to be edited. When the guide RNA matches and binds with the complementary target DNA, the Cas9 enzyme cut the DNA and make a double strand break. Although the cells try to repair this breakdown, the repair is error-prone which causes mutation in the target gene and leads to an inactivation of the gene. Thus CRISPR/Cas9 can efficiently edit a gene.
Beside the targeted knockout of gene CRISPR/Cas9 system can also help in fusing enzymes into the protein. The Cas9 can be used to transfer the enzymes into a specific DNA sequence. For example, deaminase can be transferred into DNA sequence to replace cytidine with thymidine. This type of gene editing can help to turn a disease-causing mutation into a healthy version of gene or introducing a stop codon into the gene to stop the expression of gene. Some researchers are also trying to promote the gene expression with the help of CRIPR/Cas9 system. This approach involves inactivating the Cas9 enzyme completely and transferring transcriptional factors into the gene with the Cas9 complex. So, the inactivated Cas9 do not cut the DNA, instead it helps to bind the transcriptional factor with the target genome which can ultimately promote the transcription of the gene. Alternatively, the activators can be recruited to the guide RNA which can then recruit the transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase and other factors to the target genome and thus increase the transcription. Similarly, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be utilized for gene silencing. Cas9 can be fused with a KRAB domain which can recruit more factors and inactivates the transcription by physically blocking the gene. Aside from that CRIPR/Cas9 can also be used to fuse fluorescent protein to any target genome to study its subcellular localization. This can also help to visualize the three-dimensional structure of the genome.
In summary, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has brought a revolutionary change in the various techniques of the modern genomic research starting from the targeted knockdown of gene to tuning the gene expression level and tagging the sequence of a genome with fluorescent protein.

        <h2>RNA interference (RNAi)</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on December 28, 2024</em></p>
        <p align="justify">The eukaryotic organisms have many sophisticated mechanisms to control their gene expression. RNA interference (RNAi) is a one of the natural processes where small RNA molecules inhibit gene expression by destroying specific mRNA molecules. This process is used by many organisms to control their genes. Inspired from that it is now being used as a tool in the genomic research laboratory and proposed to be used as a therapeutic measure.
RNAi involves two important types of RNA molecule - small interfering RNAs and microRNAs. Mostly both are 21 nucleotides long. Small interfering RNAs, known as siRNAs, are derived from long double-stranded RNAs that can be produced inside the cells or can be delivered into cells experimentally to manipulate the gene expression. Another type of RNAi, microRNAs (miRNA) are transcribed in the nucleus, undergo folding and processing and then get exported into the cytoplasm as a double stranded precursor miRNA. 
The siRNA and double stranded precursor miRNA then bind to an endoribonuclease protein, called dicer which can cut the RNA into smaller fragments. The short double-stranded RNA then binds to an argonaut protein, which is a family of proteins that is essential for RNA silencing and gene expression. The guide strand of the RNA remains bound to the argonaut protein and forms an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by combining with other proteins. The siRNAs direct the RISC to bind to a specific messenger RNAs. The binding is precise because the siRNAs have a perfect complementarity to their target site in the target messenger RNA. Once bound, argonaut catalyzes the cleavage of the target mRNA, which then get degraded. MicroRNAs can also guide the binding of RISC to messenger RNAs. Usually, only a part of miRNA, known as the seed, pairs with the target mRNA. This type of binding is kind of imprecise which leads to the degradation or inhibition of target mRNA from being transcribed.
